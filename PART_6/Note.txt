- Redux:
	+ Store: stores the state 
	+ Action: the state of the store is changed with Action
	+ Reducer: define the impact of the action to the state of the application
	+ Dispatch: uses to send the actions handled by reducer

- Note: If there is any change in the state, only replace the old object with the a new, changed object. (don't change the original object)

- Library: 
	+ deep-freeze: make the reducer be correctly defined as an immutable function

- Note: In JS function, default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.
